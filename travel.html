                <h5>Starting Off Solo</h5>
                <div>
                    <p>Starting off in Mexico City...what an absolutely incredible time! 
                        I was the first in my group to land as I had mistakenly booked a flight 
                        that left at 2am whilst everyone else was leaving at 8am. From New York City
                        the flight is about 5 hours, although the city is 2 hours behind EST. 
                        So as you can imagine, I landed at 5am Mexico City time and was quite tired.
                        I had only realized I booked the wrong flight a few days before, so I
                        solutioned until I came up with the bright idea to book one of the sleeping
                        pods in the Mexico City airport. I was lucky that they offered these sleepiing
                        pods at both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2.
                        The two hour nap I took was an absolute game-changer as I hadn't slept much on the plane. 
                        The pod was literally a pod. Tiny, made of metal, and very minimalistic. Inside
                        the pod they provided you with a sleeping mat, a blanket, and a small pillow. 
                        There was also a water bottle and outlet for charging as well as a mirror. The outlet in 
                        the first pod I booked wasn't working so I had them switch me to another pod. They also 
                        had bathroom facilities including showers.</p>
                <p>Around 8am I left the sleeping pod and called my uber to my group's airbnb we had booked. Technically, 
                    we were not set to check-in until 12pm. This was a bit of a logistical issue
                    for me and we messaged the airbnb host to ask if it would be alright if I came
                    and dropped off my belongings early. We received no response unfortunately so when
                    I called my uber to the neighborhood we were staying in, Condesa, I was going in blind. 
                    When I arrived, luckily I had the code from the check-in instructions and was able to successfully
                    plug in the entry code into the keypad and walk in. When I stepped inside I heard the 
                    sound of vacuuming coming from upstairs and some women speaking in Spanish. 
                    I waited in the doorway deciding how best to approach these women without
                    alarming them. I opted to wait until one of them came downstairs and used 
                    my conversational-level Spanish to mention that I had arrived early and would
                    it be alright if I dropped off my bags in the house? Fortunately, the women
                    were kind and understanding and were actually mostly done with the upstairs bedrooms.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I felt so free not having the literal weight of my massive backpack and carry-on 
                    on me. I still had 3 hours at this point until my friends arrived. I walked
                    out of the airbnb, sleep deprived, a little delirious, but mostly excited for
                    the trip ahead. I decided I would try and use the time I had alone logistically. 
                    I strolled through the tree lined streets of our new neighborhood (for 5 days) 
                    and looked up a nearby nail salon. I walked in and asked if they took walk in appointments.
                    The receptionist spoke English but my nail-tech and I spoke Spanish the whole time. 
                    My conversational abilities had worked out for me so far but I was now struggling
                    to remember the word to describe the nail shape and colors that I wanted. We eventually
                    figured it out and I discovered that although much of the time I lacked specific words, 
                    there were always work-around solutions. After the nail salon I went to a nearby grocery
                    store and got a few items I knew the group might need. I also texted everyone still
                    on the plane to see if there were any requests. I got instant coffee, bananas, oat milk, takis, 
                    and strawberries. I walked back to the airbnb impressed with how much I could accomplish while being
                    so sleep-deprived. After dropping off the groceries I went to a cafe at the end
                    of our street and ordered a cold brew. I walked back to the house facetimed my dad
                    to give him a virtual house tour while I waited for my friends to arrive. Mid-sentence showing my dad the upstairs 
                    balcony looking onto the floor below I heard the door open. My friends had arrived! Any tiredness I
                    had felt that morning momentarily subsided and I was overcome with joy that they
                    had all arrived safely and our trip could truly begin.
